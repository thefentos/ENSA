Dear Mr. F. and or Mr. B.,

about where you told me to mark everything we used ai for:

I hereby mark everything, besides the allgorithms and small parts as AI-generated.

But I want to make clear, that I understand every snipped of code, reviewed and therefore corrected and adjusted the entirety of the generated code.

I could have written everything by myself. But because of time reasons, it is just more efficient to use AI and work WITH it. Had I used the code as it was generated and not meticulously reviewed it, it would not have worked as it did.

With that I think it is ok to state, that I have a fairly large Eigenanteil in this.

LG F.
